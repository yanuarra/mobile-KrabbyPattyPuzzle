# mobile-KrabbyPattyPuzzle

This project is a 3-day challenge to create a puzzle game inspired by the classic Sandwich-stack game concept. The objective of the game is simple: stack the ingredients in the correct order to create the perfect Krabby Patty.

# Game Overview
In this game, the player must arrange three components in the correct order to form a complete sandwich:

1. Top Bun
2. Filler (meat, veggies, or other fillings)
3. Bottom Bun

The player needs to correctly position these components based on given clues or orders, simulating the process of assembling a sandwich.

# How to Play
1. The player is presented with a set of ingredients: a top bun, filler, and bottom bun.
2. The goal is to fold and arrange these ingredients in the appropriate order.
3. Once the player completes a sandwich, they will move on to the next level.
